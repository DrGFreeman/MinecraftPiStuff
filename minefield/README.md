**UPDATE (2017-04-17):** MineField now has it own repository: [DrGFreeman/MineField](https://github.com/DrGFreeman/MineField). The game has been translated to English with english comments and detailed README file. The code also got multiple improvements.

A game for Minecraft Pi edition that interracts with leds connected to GPIO pins.

As the titles says, the player has to move across a mine field to find and destroy a block of gold and then return to his starting point marked by a glowing obsidian block. The player must avoid stepping on a mine (mines are invisible). To do so, the player has a mine proximity indicator tool using blue, green, yellow and red leds connected to GPIO pins 17, 27, 22 and 16 respectively. As the player gets closer to a mine, the leds light up from blue (far) to red (dangerously close).

The code (variable names, comments and posts to player) is in French. I plan on converting it to English whenever I have some spare time.

Enjoy and feel free to give me feedback!
